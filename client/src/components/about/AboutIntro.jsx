        Panel Planet started as a tiny pop-up stall and grew into a weekly hangout spot where fans swap
        recommendations, celebrate new story arcs, and discover hidden gems. We keep our shelves curated with
        indie art books, superhero epics, slice-of-life zines, and manga favorites so there is always something new
        to explore.
